    <p #module1>This year, I’ve decided to embody the legendary Dark Knight with an epic Batman Halloween costume that captures the essence of Gotham’s hero. The costume features a sleek, form-fitting black bodysuit made from a durable, stretchy fabric that allows for both comfort and agility. The iconic bat symbol boldly emblazons the chest, a striking contrast against the dark fabric. Completing the look is a flowing cape that billows dramatically behind me, giving an air of mystery and power. A detailed cowl with pointed ears frames my face, complete with a built-in mask that hides my identity and enhances the menacing vibe. To add a touch of realism, I’ve accessorized with a utility belt filled with playful gadgets and props, while my gloves have a textured finish that mimics Batman’s armored look. As I step into the role, I can almost hear the whispers of Gotham’s villains, ready to strike fear into the hearts of anyone who dares to cross my path this Halloween.</p>
